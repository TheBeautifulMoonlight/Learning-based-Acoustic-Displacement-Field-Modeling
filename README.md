## Learning-based Acoustic Displacement Field Modeling and Micro-Particles Controlling
This repository contains the code and data associated with the research article "Learning-based Acoustic Displacement Field Modeling and Micro-Particles Controlling." Please note that the paper is currently under review and will be organized updated once the article is received and accepted.

# Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
1. neural.py: This Python script is the main file for running the Prediction code.
2. data/: This directory contains the datasets used for training and evaluation.
3. models/: This directory stores the pretrained models required for the experiments.

# Requirements
To run the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
1. Pandas
2. pytorch

# Usage
You can use the code by running the neural.py script, like this:
'''powershell
python neural.py
'''
Make sure you have the necessary datasets in the data/ directory and the required pretrained models in the models/ directory.

# Note
Please note that this code is still under review and will be updated once the article is received and accepted. We appreciate your understanding and patience during this process.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues while using the code, please don't hesitate to contact the authors of the research article.
